# LifeOptizer
## A .NET/Angular Application
LifeOptimizer came to be after a massive purge of expired food in storage as well as a general lack of ability to keep track of items stored in my home. 

The ultimate goal is develop a web application that can easily keep track of as many items in the home the user would like to keep track of. It will have the ability 
to virtually place items in various storage locations around the home. Some examples, the refridgerator, office drawers, and food storage shelving. The app will ultimately 
be useless unless it is near effortless to add/remove items from their locations. The plan is to employ AI to convert natural language to commands to add and remove items
from storage locations. 

Setting up the home will also be a challenge...We will see how it goes.
